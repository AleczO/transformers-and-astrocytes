# Transformers and Astrocytes

A collection of my work exploring transformer architectures and their connections to astrocytes, based on [Building transformers from neurons and astrocytes](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2219150120) and [Neuron–astrocyte associative memory](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2417788122).


## Current Progress

For now, I'm mainly experimenting with the basic idea of the Transformer. The Standard Transformer section provides a closer look into Transformer mechanisms from a language semantics perspective. I'm not really into language models, but the mechanisms behind basic linguistic reasoning provide better intuition. 

A deeper mathematical exploration of the Transformer model can be found in my [science notes](https://github.com/AleczO/science-notes/blob/main/Deep%20Learning/Transformer/calculations.ipynb) repository.
